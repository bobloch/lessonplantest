The basic idea is that teachers don't use 'off the shelf' lesson plans because we all have different period lengths, styles of teaching, needs etc. 

The idea here is a proof of concept of taking one lesson and how/if teachers can use Forks of it to get better and also create/store derivative versions for different uses. 

For an overview of how to do this, try this page:

See the file "LessonTest" for a very brief lesson plan description and what I'd like others to do is:
1) Suggest improvements via pull requests
2) "Fork" the lesson version to make your own version
