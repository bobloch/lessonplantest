The basic idea is that teachers don't use 'off the shelf' lesson plans because we all have different period lengths, styles of teaching, needs etc. 

The idea here is a proof of concept of taking one lesson and how/if teachers can use Forks of it to get better and also create/store derivative versions for different uses.
